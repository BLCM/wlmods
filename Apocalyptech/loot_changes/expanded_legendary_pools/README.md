Expanded Legendary Pools
========================

This mod adds all legendary/unique items to the main world-drop pools --
basically anything with red text.  This currently includes all items from:

* DLC1 (Coiled Captors)
* DLC2 (Glutton's Gamble)
* DLC3 (Molten Mirrors)
* DLC4 (Shattering Spectreglass)

I recommend using this with my Uniques Are Legendary mod, which will make
the red-text blue/purple gear more noticeable when they drop.

Changelog
=========

**v1.1.0** - Aug 12, 2022
 * Updated with new DLC4 gear

**v1.0.2** - Jul 29, 2022
 * Added missing Fealty Oath ring, from DLC3.
 * Removed useless/unfinished "Big B Mittens" armor
 * Tweaked Armor That Sucks and Harmonious Dingledangle additions so that they
   take advantage of class-weighting probabilities (they now play nicely with
   No Wasted Gear).
 * Cleared out duplicate DLC-gear entries from pools.

**v1.0.1** - Jul 28, 2022
 * Removed the Used Antique Greatbow from the legendary pools.  Hadn't realized
   what that weapon's deal was, previously.

**v1.0.0** - Jul 27, 2022
 * Initial version, based on v1.6.0 of
   [BL3's Expanded Legendary Pools](https://github.com/BLCM/bl3mods/wiki/Expanded%20Legendary%20Pools)
