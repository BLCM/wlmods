Expanded Legendary Pools
========================

This mod adds all legendary/unique items to the main world-drop pools --
basically anything with red text.  This currently includes all items from:

* DLC1 (Coiled Captors)
* DLC2 (Glutton's Gamble)
* DLC3 (Molten Mirrors)

I recommend using this with my Uniques Are Legendary mod, which will make
the red-text blue/purple gear more noticeable when they drop.

TODO
====

* There are a few balances in here which are split up by Class.  It'd be nice
  to use character-specific weighting to those, rather than our even probabilities.

Changelog
=========

**v1.0.0** - Jul 27, 2022
 * Initial version, based on v1.6.0 of
   [BL3's Expanded Legendary Pools](https://github.com/BLCM/bl3mods/wiki/Expanded%20Legendary%20Pools)
