Early Bloomer
=============

Unlocks all weapon types, elements, manufacturers, enchantments, etc, from the very
beginning of the game, in addition to unlocking all available inventory slots.

The first few pickups/chests encountered in Snoring Valley are still locked to
providing some specific gear (unless you also make use of my Starting Gear mod),
but you'll start seeing the full variety of gear from enemy drops even in that
starting level.
