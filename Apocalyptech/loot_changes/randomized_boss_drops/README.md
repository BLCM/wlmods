Randomized Boss Drops
=====================

Randomizes boss drops (ie: get rid of dedicated loot pools).  Obviously this will
be of no interest to anyone looking to farm specific gear, but for myself, I
prefer the more randomized loot approach.

The drops will retain the *type* of drop, so if a boss was going to drop a specific
legendary shotgun, you will get a legendary shotgun of some sort.

I recommend the use of my Expanded Legendary Pools mod, so that the loot you get
is as varied as possible.

**Mod Compatibility Info:**

If you use this mod along with Guaranteed Boss Drops, make sure that this mod
appears *after* Guaranteed Boss Drops in your mod list.  (For OpenHotfixLoader,
you can just rename the filenames to make sure that happens, though if you
keep the filenames at their defaults, that should already be the case.)
