Randomized Mission Rewards
==========================

Like my Randomized Boss Drops mod, this randomizes all mission rewards, so you
won't actually know what you're getting for completing missions.  You *will*
receive the same *type* of item that you'd expect, so if a mission ordinarily
gives you a shotgun, you'll still get a shotgun.

It's recommended to use my Expanded Legendary Pools mod with this, to give
you a wider variety of rewards
