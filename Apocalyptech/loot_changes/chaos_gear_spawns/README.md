Chaos Gear Spawns
=================

This is actually a collection of mods which alter how Chaos Gear is spawned
when in Chaos Mode.  Ordinarily, Chaotic, Volatile, Primordial, and Ascended
gear are unlocked by specific Chaos Levels, and drops may not end up with
a Chaos buff of their own.  These mods alter that spawning behavior in
various ways.

The available variants are:

* **Defaults** - This can be used to go back to the default configuration.
  Possibly handy if you want to switch back without having to restart the
  game.
* **Guaranteed** - All dropped gear will have a Chaos level attached to it,
  when in Chaos Mode.  Otherwise, continues to use the stock game weights
  for which one gets spawned.  As of the September 2022 patch, by the time
  you get to Chaos 50 or so, you'll actually be slightly better off with
  the default Chaos config, though they even out awhile after that.
* **No Chaos Gear** - Prevents Chaos-buffed gear from spawning at all.
  Useful if you want to use Chaos Mode as a "simple" difficulty slider,
  without introducing another keep/throw-away factor for gear.
* **All Chaotic** - All dropped gear will be Chaotic, in Chaos Mode.
* **All Volatile** - All dropped gear will be Volatile, in Chaos Mode.
* **All Primordial** - All dropped gear will be Primordial, in Chaos Mode.
* **All Ascended** - All dropped gear will be Ascended, in Chaos Mode.
* **Just Regular and Ascended** - Restricts drops to either normal or
  Ascended.
* **Just Regular, Primordial, and Ascended** - Restricts drops to be
  normal, Primordial, or Ascended.

Changelog

**v1.1.1** - Oct 3, 2022
 * Removed setting of "catchup" variables internally, which are actually
   used to specify how many Chaos levels are gained with each chamber.
   Setting them in here might've gotten in the way of future mods, by
   accident.

*(no version number change)* - Sep 30, 2022
 * Added "Just Regular and Ascended" and "Just Regular, Primordial, and
   Ascended" variants, from skruntskrunt
