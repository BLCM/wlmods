Chaos Gear Spawns
=================

This is actually a collection of mods which alter how Chaos Gear is spawned
when in Chaos Mode.  Ordinarily, Chaotic, Volatile, Primordial, and Ascended
gear are unlocked by specific Chaos Levels, and drops may not end up with
a Chaos buff of their own.  These mods alter that spawning behavior in
various ways.

The available variants are:

* **Defaults** - This can be used to go back to the default configuration.
  Possibly handy if you want to switch back without having to restart the
  game.
* **Guaranteed** - All dropped gear will have a Chaos level attached to it,
  when in Chaos Mode.  Otherwise, continues to use the stock game weights
  for which one gets spawned.
* **No Chaos Gear** - Prevents Chaos-buffed gear from spawning at all.
  Useful if you want to use Chaos Mode as a "simple" difficulty slider,
  without introducing another keep/throw-away factor for gear.
* **All Chaotic** - All dropped gear will be Chaotic, in Chaos Mode.
* **All Volatile** - All dropped gear will be Volatile, in Chaos Mode.
* **All Primordial** - All dropped gear will be Primordial, in Chaos Mode.
* **All Ascended** - All dropped gear will be Ascended, in Chaos Mode.
