Fix Broken Loot Patterns
========================

A couple of enemies drop at least part of their loot in a single tight point,
making it impossible to sort through without picking some of it up first.  This
mod fixes that up so that the loot gets spread out in a more pleasing manner.
If other enemies are found to have similar problems in the future, they'll be
added in here.  At the moment this is just Knight Mare and Zomboss.

This functionality is included in Guaranteed Boss Drops, so there's no need
to use this mod if you're already using that one.  (It won't hurt anything to
have both enabled, though.)
