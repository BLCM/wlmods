No Loot Luck: Better Loot Edition
=================================

The "Loot Luck" mechanic in Tiny Tina's Wonderlands is actually pretty
nifty -- it's a good way to get a nice progression of gear quality
throughout the game while giving a useful metric to the player.
Assuming the player is fastidious about picking up Lost Dice while
running the game, the loot quality near the endgame is quite good and
really doesn't need any buffing.

However, while I appreciated this mechanic on my first Wonderlands
playthrough, I definitely prefer to just have good loot throughtout the 
whole game when replaying.  Hence, this mod!

No Loot Luck completely removes Loot Luck's impact on the loot quality
throughout the game.  Loot will be equally as good at the beginning of the game
as it is at the end, regardless of how much your Loot Luck stat
increases.  This should also nerf any improvements which would be made
via Chaos Mode or the like.

The loot quality for this mod is roughly on par with what BL3's Better
Loot mod uses, which was in turn inherited from the 'Very Good' preset
of my BL2/TPS Better Loot mods.  Legendaries are maybe a *bit* too
common, but I prefer too much to too little.

Note too that the "Better Loot" in the title *only* refers to the base
loot quality weights.  This mod does *not* alter any other aspect of
Wonderlands loot, like boss uniques, etc.
