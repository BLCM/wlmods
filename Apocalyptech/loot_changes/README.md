See the individual mod folders for full READMEs.

- **Chaos Gear Spawns** - Alters how Chaos-infused gear (Chaotic, Volatile, Primordial,
  or Ascended) are spawned in Chaos Mode.
- **Customization Drop Rate** - A set of mods to change the drop rates for customizations,
  from none at all, to much more than usual.
- **Early Bloomer**- Unlock all weapon types, elements, manufacturers,
  enchantments, etc, from the very beginning of the game.
- **Expanded Legendary Pools** - Adds all legendary/unique items to the world drop pools.
- **More Elemental Weapons** - Increases the probability of rolling the elemental version
  of any given weapon.
- **No Wasted Equipment** - Armor and Amulet parts will always match the player(s)

  gear pickups/chests, in Snoring Valley.
