Apocalyptech's Loot-Related WL Mods
===================================

See the individual mod folders for full READMEs.

- **Chaos Gear Spawns** - Alters how Chaos-infused gear (Chaotic, Volatile, Primordial,
  or Ascended) are spawned in Chaos Mode.
- **Customization Drop Rate** - A set of mods to change the drop rates for customizations,
  from none at all, to much more than usual.
- **Early Bloomer**- Unlock all weapon types, elements, manufacturers,
  enchantments, etc, from the very beginning of the game.
- **Expanded Legendary Pools** - Adds all legendary/unique items to the world drop pools.
- **Guaranteed Boss Drops** - Bosses/minibosses will always drop from their unique-drop pools.
- **Guaranteed Enchantments** - All dropped/looted gear will be enchanted, if the gear
  supports it.
- **More Elemental Weapons** - Increases the probability of rolling the elemental version
  of any given weapon.
- **No Loot Luck: Better Loot Edition** - Completely removes the effect of Loot Luck on
  gear drops, setting them instead to traditional Better Loot quality weighting.
- **No Wasted Equipment** - Armor and Amulet parts will always match the player(s)
  currently in the game.  Will eventually support Enchantments too, but that isn't done yet.
- **Randomized Boss Drops** - Boss/miniboss drops will be randomized, instead of locked
  to their usual unique drops.
- **Randomized Mission Rewards** - Mission reward items will be randomized.
- **Starting Gear** - Some alternate contents for the initial starting
  gear pickups/chests, in Snoring Valley.
