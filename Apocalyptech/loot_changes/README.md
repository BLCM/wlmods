Apocalyptech's Loot-Related WL Mods
===================================

See the individual mod folders for full READMEs.

- **Customization Drop Rate** - A set of mods to change the drop rates for customizations,
  from none at all, to much more than usual.
- **Early Bloomer**- Unlock all weapon types, elements, manufacturers,
  enchantments, etc, from the very beginning of the game.
- **Expanded Legendary Pools** - Adds all legendary/unique items to the world drop pools.
- **No Wasted Equipment** - Armor and Amulet parts will always match the player(s)
  currently in the game.  Will eventually support Enchantments too, but that isn't done yet.
- **Starting Gear** - Some alternate contents for the initial starting
  gear pickups/chests, in Snoring Valley.
