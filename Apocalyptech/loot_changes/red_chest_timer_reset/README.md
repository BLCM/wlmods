Red Chest Timer Reset
=====================

Prevents the game's red chests from remembering their opened state when
quitting and restarting the game.  They will still have their usual timers
while staying within the same game session, but a trip to the main menu
will now let them be re-opened right away.

**Note:** Any red chest timer information currently stored in your savegame
will still apply when you go into the game, even with this mod active.
You can either wait for those timers to expire as usual, or just quit out
to the main menu once to clear it out.
