Guaranteed Boss Drops
=====================

Guarantees that all bosses / minibosses will always drop their unique
loot 100% of the time.  Additionally, bosses with more than one drop
will drop more than once from the pool -- once per item available.
This gives you a chance to get one of each item from a single boss
run.  An exception is the thirteen enemies who drop from a shared
'miniboss' pool which contains 8 items.  Those enemies will only
drop a single item from that pool.

For a list of what drops you should expect from bosses, while using this mod, see
[`expected_drops.md`](https://github.com/BLCM/wlmods/blob/main/Apocalyptech/loot_changes/guaranteed_boss_drops/expected_drops.md).

The mod contains a few fixes as well, such as allowing some Chaos-Chamber-locked
minibosses to drop their loot outside of the Chaos Chamber, fixing some
details of Knight Mare and Zomboss's drop behavior, and fixing Imelda the Sand
Witch's Difficulty 4 drop.

**Mod Compatibility Info:**

If you use this mod along with
[Randomized Boss Drops](https://github.com/BLCM/wlmods/wiki/Randomized%20Boss%20Drops),
make sure that this mod appears *before* Randomized Boss Drops in your mod
list.  (For OpenHotfixLoader, you can just rename the filenames to make sure
that happens, though if you keep the filenames at their defaults, that should
already be the case.)

This mod includes the functionality from
[Fix Broken Loot Patterns](https://github.com/BLCM/wlmods/wiki/Fix%20Broken%20Loot%20Patterns),
so there's no need to run both at the same time.  It won't hurt anything if
you do, though.
