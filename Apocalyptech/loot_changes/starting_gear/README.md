Starting Gear
=============

This is actually two different mods, both of which alter the contents of the
initial gear found in Snoring Valley, when starting the game.  In the vanilla
game, there's a white-rarity axe, then a chest with a white-rarity gun, then
a chest with a white-rarity ward, and finally a white-rarity spell pickup.
The variants provided here:

* **Full Loadout** - The melee and spell pickups have been updated to be
  world drops (instead of hardcoded white-rarity).  The initial gun chest will
  now contain two pistols, a ward, a set of armor, a ring, and an amulet.
  The initial ward chest will have a second ring and a spell, in addition to
  a world drop ward.  You'll need to be using my Early Bloomer mod for some
  of the "advanced" gear to show up (armor, rings, amulet).
* **Testing Gear** - This is mostly for my own purposes, but makes the initial
  melee pickup a Goblin Pickaxe, and then alters the initial gun chest to
  contain a Manual Transmission AR and Transistor ward.  You will need to be using
  my Early Bloomer mod to see those, and this is intended to be used with my
  Super Buff mods (from my mod-testing folder).  This variant will also update
  the ward chest and spell pickup to use world drops rather than hardcoded
  white-rarity.

As mentioned above, you'll need to be using my Early Bloomer mod to be able to
make full use of these; otherwise the more advanced gear might not spawn,
and you also might be locked into early-game manufacturers and parts for the
pistols, too.  The "Testing Gear" variant, especially, will soft-lock your
game without Early Bloomer, because the Goblin Pickaxe won't spawn on the
initial melee-weapon pickup, and you'll be unable to continue (until you
disable this mod and/or enable Early Bloomer, that is).
