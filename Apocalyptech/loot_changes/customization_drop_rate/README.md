Customization Drop Rate
=======================

This is a collection of mods which lets you determine how often cosmetic items
will drop from the game.  They could be useful both to folks looking to acquire
all cosmetic items, or to turn off cosmetic drops entirely, if you've already
collected the lot.

The default drop rate for cosmetics in the game varies depending on the enemy
type -- this mod just improves each by a set factor.  The four variants
available here are:

* **None** - 0x
* **Improved** - 6x
* **Frequent** - 12x
* **Constant** - 24x

Given the volume of cosmetics, even at 24x it'll probably still take you ages to
collect them all.  Note that *dedicated* cosmetic drops (if there are any in the
game) may be unaffected by this.  As of initial release, the mod hasn't been
tested super thoroughly, so there could be areas which need fixing up.
