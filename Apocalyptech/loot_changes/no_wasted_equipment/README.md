No Wasted Equipment
===================

This mod makes it so that class-specific attributes will only ever spawn in a version
which is useful to a player currently in the game.  This currently applies to armor
and amulets.  It's intended to handle class-specific Enchantments too, but that is
not yet present in the mod.

In a singleplayer game, before speccing into a secondary skill, the secondary class buff
on Purple/Legendary armor should be evenly random across all possibilities (the primary
will always match your primary class).  Once you spec into a secondary class, armor drops
will start being correctly restricted to both classes, and should swap which one's
primary/secondary, depending on how the drop rolls.

This *should* adjust itself automatically whenever players enter/leave a co-op session,
though that is currently untested by myself.

**Note:** There are a few class-specific balances which aren't covered by this mod,
such as the Armor That Sucks and the Harmonious Dingledangle.

**Also Note:** As mentioned above, this mod is not yet at 1.0.0 -- namely, class-specific
Enchantments are not handled at all.  I do intend to implement that, but it seems super
annoying in WL, so I'm procrastinating.
