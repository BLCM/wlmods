Mega TimeSaver XL
=================

This mod aims to speed up nearly all the noticeably-slow interactive
objects that you use throughout WL.  It will eventually hope to encompass
basically the entire game, but **it is currently a work in progress!**

As such, this mod has not seen an awful lot of testing, so please let me
know if there's anything game-breaking or Obviously Wrong with this (like
if a too-fast animation ends up breaking mission progression somewhere).
Ordinarily I wouldn't release this until I'd had a chance to thoroughly
test it, but there's some fairly deep mining I need to do in the data to
finish it properly

Currently, the mod attempts to affect the following:

* Lootable Containers
* Doors
* Possibly some Switches

TODO
====

* Haven't yet really run through the game often enough to have a feel
  for what might feel slow still.

Changelog
=========

**v0.9.0** - Jul 28, 2022
 * Initial beta release.  Incomplete, but should be handy regardless!
   Based on v0.9.1 of [BL3's Mega TimeSaver XL](https://github.com/BLCM/bl3mods/wiki/Mega%20TimeSaver%20XL)
