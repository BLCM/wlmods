Always Visible Challenge Icons
==============================

This mod attempts to make all challenge icons (Poetry Pages, Rune Switch Puzzles, etc)
always appear on the map, regardless of if you've been close to them.  This does
*not* do anything for Lucky Dice, since those don't have map icons, and only need to
be unlocked once per profile anyway.

This will reveal Overworld challenge icons as well, though due to some
differences in how the game deals with dungeons, shrine pieces contained in
dungeons still require getting close to the dungeon to get those to show up on
the map.  The detection radius has been increased a *bit* for those, though.

Note that you will miss dialog if you use this: when entering a new map, only one of
the available challenge intros will be played.

TODO
====

* Would be nice to figure out how to get shrine-piece-containing dungeons to
  show up automatically, instead of just having a larger detection radius.  For
  some reason, though, they just don't show up at all if the player starts out
  inside the radius.
