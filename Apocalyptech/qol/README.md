- **Always Visible Challenge Icons** - Makes challenge icons visible at all
  times
- **Closer Destruction Rains From The Heavens** - Moves all three dungeons
  from this sidequest next to the quest-giver.
- **Mega TimeSaver XL** - Speeds up slow animations throughout the game.
- **More Visible Scrolls** - Makes the scroll loot bars (and, incidentally,
  mission items) far more visible
- **No Blacksmith Hammers** - Disables the loud automatic hammers in the
  Brighthoof blacksmith area (right next to the enchantment-reroll machine)
- **No Reload Notification** - Removes the "reload" notification when you're
  near the end of a magazine.
- **Photo Mode Unlock** - Lets the camera in Photo Mode go extremely far, and
  speeds up its movement.
