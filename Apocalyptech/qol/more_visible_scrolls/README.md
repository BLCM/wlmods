More Visible Scrolls
====================

Makes ECHO log loot bars (and any other item using the same bar definition
in the game data, which includes mission items) much bigger and noticeable.
I wrote this to help me spot the odd ECHO that I might have missed during
playthroughs.

Note that the game does not typically draw loot bars for items which are
hidden behind level geometry, so you generally still have to have roughly
line-of-sight to the ECHO in question, to see the loot bar at all.  This
can lead to some situations where strafing slightly to one direction might
cause a huge loot bar to suddenly appear.
