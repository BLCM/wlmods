Skip DLC Intros
===============

Skips the intro movies played at the beginning of Coiled Captors,
Glutton's Gamble, and Molten Mirrors, in Dreamveil Overlook.  This
does *not* seem to work for Shattering Spectreglass, despite the
mod's attempts to do so.

Internally, the mod attempts the intro-movie-skip via a couple of
different methods for each DLC, and I'm honestly not sure why some
methods work and some don't (and why DLC4 seems especially resistant).
I *suspect* that part of the problem could be related to object-loading
timing, and if that's the case then it's possible other people's
machines might end up behaving a bit differently than mine.  Therefore,
I'm leaving in both methods for each DLC.  Let me know if the DLC4
skip works for you, or if it *doesn't* work for DLC1, 2, or 3!

TODO
====

* Would be quite nice to figure out DLC4, and get a handle on why
  some methods work and others don't, depending on DLC.
