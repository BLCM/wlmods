###
### Unlocks the camera in Photo Mode to be able to go extremely far.  Possibly
### not to the full extent of every level -- I've not tested thoroughly -- but
### you can zip about quite a ways.  Also buffs up the camera move speed so that
### it's not agonizing having to go over so much terrain.  That might make lining
### up precise angles a bit harder, but c'est la vie!
###
### Also reduces the camera's collision radius to zero, which doesn't let it clip
### directly through objects, but it can often slip through real tiny seams.
