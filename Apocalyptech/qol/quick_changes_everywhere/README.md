Quick Changes Everywhere
========================

Introduces a Quick Change station to every level in the game which
didn't already have one.

The Quick Change placements should in general be pretty obvious, and
placed around the "main" Fast Travel location in each map.  Some larger
maps have more than one station placed, and a couple might have the
station in a less-than-obvious location.  Here's the ones which might
be slightly less obvious, or where there's more than one per map:

- **Snoring Valley:** Tucked to the side of a building before the first
  waystone.
- **Queen's Gate:** Two stations, at the beginning and end of the level.
- **Mount Craw:** Three stations, near all three of the fast travels.
- **Weepwild Dankness:** At the map entrance, and before the Banshee
  area.
- **Tangledrift:** Just one station, in Driftwood.
- **Wargtooth Shallows:** Three stations, near all three of the fast
  travels.  The one near the entrance is much closer to the actual
  level entrance than the fast travel marker, though.
- **Crackmast Cove:** The single station is against a building right
  outside the entrance cave.
- **Drowned Abyss:** Stations at the level entrance and at The
  Seapulchre.
- **Karnok's Wall:** Three stations, one for each fast travel point.
  The Soultorn Rise station is actually down the stairs a bit, towards
  the level entrance.
- **Sunfang Oasis:** Three stations - one at Everfrost Icetomb, and
  the other two near the Chestward Locks fast travel: one tucked next
  to a building toward the level entrance, and another above the fast
  travel, near the "elevator" to the boss battle.
- **Ossu-Gol Necropolis:** Three stations: One a little ways after the
  level entrance (before the bridge), one around the corner from the Elder's
  hideout, and one at the Hall of Heroes fast travel.
- **The Fearamid:** The single station is on the platform below the 
  level entrance (and "Facing Fear" fast travel).
- **Crest of Fate:** Two stations before the elevator, just for symmetry!

Let me know if you've got any alternate placements for these which you
think might make sense, either as an alternative to what I have in here
or as an addition.

**Compatibility Note:** This mod will *not* be compatible with any other
mod which adds in Quick Change stations to the same levels.
