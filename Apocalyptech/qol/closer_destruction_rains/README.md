Closer Destruction Rains From The Heavens
=========================================

Moves all three dungeons from the post-game sidequest "Destruction Rains
From the Heavens" to be right next to their quest-giver, rather than
requiring the Fatemaker to tromp all around the Overworld.  This also
has the side effect of moving them all from behind the red Dark Magic
Barriers, though the dungeons still won't be accessible until the quest
has been picked up.
