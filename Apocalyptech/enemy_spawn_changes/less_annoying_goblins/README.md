Less Annoying Goblins
=====================

I've always found the Goblins in Wonderlands to be rather annoying to fight,
and this mod aims to reduce some of that annoyance.  It's not intended to
*nerf* Goblin combat, though it probably does that inadvertently.  Many of
the things I'm changing are pretty obviously intended behavior, and by sanding
off the corners of Goblin combat, it's removing some of the unique features
of this enemy type.  C'est la vie!

In general, my complaints fall into two categories: physically-tiny enemies who
are easy to miss when they're right next to you doing melee attacks, and
extreme knockbacks from a couple of enemy types (Trickster barrel-charges and
Badass rocket blasts, specifically).

The specific changes done by this mod:

* Goblin Runt
  * Increase overall size by 27%, and height by an additional 14%
  * Increase health by 13% to compensate
* Goblin Axe Thrower
  * Increase overall size by 17%, and height by an additional 14%
  * Increase health by 8% to compensate
* Goblin Guzzlebuster *(suicide goblins)*
  * Increase size by 25%
  * Icon will show up on minimap even while cloaked
* Goblin Tinkerer
  * Make jetpack-charge attacks a little less common
* Goblin Trickster *(the barrel one)*
  * Decrease charge speed by 40%
  * Severely nerf knockback
  * Increase damage-dealt by 10% to compensate
* Badass Goblin Bombast
  * Severely nerf knockback for rocket attacks

The remainder of the Goblin enemies were left alone (Gunslinger,
Bushwhacker, Sapper, Imp, Flamerider, Frostwretch, Thundercaller,
and Badass Guard).
