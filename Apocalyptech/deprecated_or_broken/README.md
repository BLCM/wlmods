## Proofs of Concept

These are things that *work*, and I wanted to keep track of, but which
weren't actually intended to be mods themselves.

- `achievement_shenanigans.txt` - I had the two co-op achievements left on
  Steam, and since I basically never do multiplayer, I decided to see if I could
  cheese 'em.  Turns out to be quite easy; just made them both depend on my
  AR kill count, and set the target to one higher than that current stat from
  my save.  No plans to make this into a full mod, but if anyone else is
  interested, this is how you'd do it.
