Early Overworld Abilities
=========================

This mod allows the player to dispel barrier hexes and see hidden bridges
from the very beginning of the game.  It also removes the red Dark Magic
barriers entirely.  It does not, at the moment, unlock the ability to
smash barriers early, though since that's literally the first thing you
do when in the Overworld, that's not too much of a downside.

The mod also unlocks the barrier hexes inside Karnok's Wall, so they are
usable on the first runthrough of that map, rather than having to wait
until the end of the level and then backtrack.  Barrier hexes in maps
like Ossu-Gol Necropolis are untouched, and might still require the
original mission requirements, in case you're cheekily sequence-breaking
your way to that map early.

Users of this mod may be interested in
[Better Overworld Movement](https://github.com/BLCM/wlmods/wiki/Better%20Overworld%20Movement)
as well, which makes this mod a bit superfluous by enabling jumping and
sprinting on the Overworld, which allows the player to bypass most of
these barriers pretty easily anyway.
