Short Overworld Dungeons
========================

Shortens all of the Overworld dungeons in a couple of ways.  All
Overworld dungeons will only be a single room long, and many will
have shortened enemy waves, as well.  This applies to
mission-related Overworld dungeons as well as the shrine piece
dungeons (and any other connective dungeons which may exist as
well).

This mod *shouldn't* affect anything about Chaos Chamber runs, or
the DLC "dungeon" runs.
