Movement Speed Cheats
=====================

These mods increase your movement speed in the game, which also applies
to companions (Demi-Lich, Wyvern, and Mushroom).  There are three variants:

* **Reasonable** - Personally, I find this a very pleasant pace at
  which to play the game.  Still rather cheaty, but not ridiculuous.
* **Extreme** - This is what I use while testing mods.  Not really
  intended for actual play.
* **Normal** - This sets the movement speeds back to their normal
  values.  This could be useful if you want to revert a previously-
  applied movement speed mod without having to quit the game entirely.
  Probably only of interest to mod authors under specific circumstances.

Note that the speed increases affect sliding as well, which includes the
slides in levels like Tangledrift.  A couple of the slides in Tangledrift
specifically become very difficult with the "Reasonable" variant, and may
be nearly impossible with "Extreme."  You're likely to get thrown off
the slide when cornering, etc.  With Reasonable, at least, they're still
workable if you jump pretty frequently to use air control to align
yourself back up, but that may or may not be feasible with Extreme.
