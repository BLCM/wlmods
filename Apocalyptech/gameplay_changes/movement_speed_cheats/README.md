Movement Speed Cheats
=====================

These mods increase your movement speed in the game, which also applies
to companions (Demi-Lich, Wyvern, and Mushroom).  There are three variants:

* **Reasonable** - Personally, I find this a very pleasant pace at
  which to play the game.  Still rather cheaty, but not ridiculuous.
* **Extreme** - This is what I use while testing mods.  Not really
  intended for actual play.
* **Normal** - This sets the movement speeds back to their normal
  values.  This could be useful if you want to revert a previously-
  applied movement speed mod without having to quit the game entirely.
  Probably only of interest to mod authors under specific circumstances.
