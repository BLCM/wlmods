Better Overworld Movement
=========================

This mod allows you to jump and sprint while in the Overworld.  This
can almost certainly be used for sequence-breaking, should you desire
such shenanigans.

Users of this mod may be interested in
[Early Overworld Abilities](https://github.com/BLCM/wlmods/wiki/Easier%20Overworld%20Abilities)
as well, which allows the player to dispel hex barriers, see hidden
bridges, and bypass red Dark Magic barriers from the beginning of the
game.
