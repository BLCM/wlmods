Skip To DLC Bosses
==================

When entering a mirror in Dreamveil Overlook, to start one of the
DLC missions, this mod will send you straight to the final room
with the boss battle instead.  Much more efficient farming!

There's also a version which, for Shattering Spectreglass (DLC4),
drops you into the Raging Wyborg room instead of Redmourne, in
case you wanted to farm that boss as well (that version will then
continue on to Redmourne normally after that).
