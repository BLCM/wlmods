Full Poems On Pickup
====================

This mod makes it so picking up the lost poetry pages throughout the game will
cause the full poem to be read, instead of just the first line or two.  Note
that Tina's postscript, telling you to head to Brighthoof to hear the whole
poem, will still play after the poem has been completed.

Two caveats:
* The audio should properly localize (though this is untested), but it's very
  likely that the poem subtitles will be hardcoded to the English version.
* Picking up the very last poem omits playing the poem entirely.  This is
  the case in the vanilla game, too -- you don't even get the first line
  for the very last one.
