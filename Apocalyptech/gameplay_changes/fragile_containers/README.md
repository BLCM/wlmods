Fragile Containers
==================

Makes the majority of containers in the game openable by taking damage from any
source -- guns, spells, barrel explosions, etc.

Some containers in the game are made of sterner stuff than the rest, and can't
be shot open.  These are the ones that'll have to be opened the boring old-fashioned
way:
 - Dungeon / Random Encounter reward chests
 - The red chest in Shattergrave Barrow containing the Tome of Fate
 - The pearl-containing chests in Wargtooth Shallows, during Raiders of the Lost Shark
 - Bones Three-Wood's reward chests at the end of Ballad of Bones, in Wargtooth
   Shallows, and at the end of A Hearty Aye, in Crackmast Cove
 - Most of the ammo chests in the Dread Lord / Ancient Powers mini-arena
