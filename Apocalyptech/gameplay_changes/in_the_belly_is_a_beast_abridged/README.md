In The Belly Is A Beast: Abridged
=================================

Skips the majority of the Crackmast Cove side mission "In the Belly Is
A Beast," and removes all quest dialogue.  Sometimes Otto will teleport
back to the mission start when you're on your way to the whale, but
that doesn't appear to lock up the mission at all -- he'll teleport back
when trapped by Viscetta.

It's not recommended to activate this mod while you've already got this
quest active.  Due to the dialogue-disabling part, there are a few spots
along the journey to the whale where Otto has a tendency to get stuck in
an A-pose, including one spot where it seems to happen with 100%
frequency.  (This is why the mod skips the majority of the quest, in
fact -- it was originally meant to just remove the dialogue.)  If that
does happen, though, a quit to the main menu and back should, at least,
get you going again.  Still, better to only activate the mod *before*
picking up the quest!
