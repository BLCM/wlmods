Apocalyptech's Economy-Related WL Mods
======================================

These are all quite cheaty.  Both cash and eridium-based economies basically
completely fall apart if you use all these, especially if Better Loot is also
being used, which gives you far more Eridium than usual.

See the individual mod folders for full READMEs.

- **Cheaper SDUs** - Vastly reduce the SDU costs.
- **Free Respawn** - No charge for respawning after death.
- **Free Respec** - No charge to respec your skills.
