Uniques Are Legendary
=====================

Turns all red-text weapons/items into legendary rarity, if they aren't already.
Mostly just intended to be used along with my Expanded Legendary Pools mod, to
make the dropped gear more noticeable.  Without that mod, I think these mostly
just come as mission rewards or as mission items, so this mod would be a bit
pointless.

I'm actually not sure if being legendary has an effect on item stats; it's
possible that this mod buffs up some items here.
