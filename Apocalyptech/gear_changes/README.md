Apocalyptech's Gear-Related WL Mods
===================================

Note that for mods which change part lists for gear, the mod will only apply to
*newly-dropped* items.

See the individual mod folders for full READMEs.

- **Enchantment-Spawning Tweaks** - Some collected changes to how Enchantments get
  spawned on gear.  (All applicable gear, even chances, and supported class weighting.)
- **Morph-A-Gun™ 2000** - A set of mods to make guns morph into other guns the instant
  they're fired.
- **Red Text Explainer** - Adds a description of weapon/spell special effects on the card.
- **Torgue AR Full-Auto** - Makes nearly all Torgue ARs full-auto.
- **Uniques are Legendary** - Changes the rarity of unique (usually blue/purple) items
  to be legendary instead.

There's one directory in here which is an interactive utility, rather
than a mod:

- **Arbitrary Partlocks** - Given a balance object, interactively define partlocks for it.
