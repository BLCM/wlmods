Apocalyptech's Gear-Related WL Mods
===================================

Note that for mods which change part lists for gear, the mod will only apply to
*newly-dropped* items.

See the individual mod folders for full READMEs.

There's one directory in here which is an interactive utility, rather
than a mod:

- **Arbitrary Partlocks** - Given a balance object, interactively define partlocks for it.
