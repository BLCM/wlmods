Super Buff: Transistor
======================

Cheat mod which gives the Transistor shield the following:

* Zero recharge delay
* Extraordinarily fast recharge
* Disables Reflect, Spike, and Vagabond augments

The augment part changes will only apply to freshly-dropped Transistors,
not any which are currently in your inventory.  I disabled those in
particular because I value consistency in my testing gear.  I generally
don't want damage being dealt to anything unless I specifically want
it to.

A level 1 Transistor using this mod should easily last you throughout an
entire story runthough, and probably into Chaos levels after that.

This is basically just what I use for testing out mods, when I don't
want to be bothered by combat.  Note that this will *not* protect you
from hardcoded insta-death scenarios, of course.
