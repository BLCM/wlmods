Apocalyptech's Mod-Testing WL Mods
==================================

These are a collection of mods that I basically just only use when I'm looking
to test out other mods.  They're focused on making ridiculous OP buffs to gear
so I don't have to worry about combat, and quickly levelling up characters, etc.

See the individual mod folders for full READMEs.

- **Force Enemy Spawns** - Resource mod to attempt to force a configured enemy
  type to spawn whenever possible.
- **Guaranteed Gear Drops** - Enemies with a chance to drop gear will drop one
  of each gear type (gun, melee weapon, ward, etc.)
- **Mountaineer** - Allows the player to climb (nearly) vertical surfaces.
- **Quick Chaos Chamber Loot Room** - Replaces the "Normal" Chaos Chamber run with
  a version which jumps right to the loot room, and gives you 1m crystals.
- **Show Att Values** - Show arbitrary attribute values on the Chaos Mode screen.
- **Super Buff: Goblin Pickaxe** - Absurdly OP Goblin Pickaxe buffs.
- **Super Buff: Manual Transmission** - Absurdly OP Manual Transmission AR.
- **Super Buff: Transistor** - Absurdly OP Transistor shield.
- **Testing Loot Drops** - Used to test drops and verify balance names.
- **Visible BPChar Names** - Displays the BPChar names for NPCs and Enemies
  in-game, instead of their usual names.
