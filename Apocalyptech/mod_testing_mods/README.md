Apocalyptech's Mod-Testing WL Mods
==================================

These are a collection of mods that I basically just only use when I'm looking
to test out other mods.  They're focused on making ridiculous OP buffs to gear
so I don't have to worry about combat, and quickly levelling up characters, etc.

See the individual mod folders for full READMEs.

- **Mountaineer** - Allows the player to climb (nearly) vertical surfaces.
- **Super Buff: Goblin Pickaxe** - Absurdly OP Goblin Pickaxe buffs.
- **Super Buff: Manual Transmission** - Absurdly OP Manual Transmission AR.
- **Super Buff: Transistor** - Absurdly OP Transistor shield.
- **Testing Loot Drops** - Used to test drops and verify balance names.
