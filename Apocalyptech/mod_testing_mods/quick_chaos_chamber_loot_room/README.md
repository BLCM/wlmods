Quick Chaos Chamber Loot Room
=============================

Resource mod to aid in testing out Chaos Chamber loot-room mods.  Replaces
the 'Normal' Chaos Chamber run with a 'Loot Run' which skips right to the
loot room, and makes the central chest give you one million crystals to
play with.  This was originally written while working on my Mega TimeSaver
XL mod, since I was working on both the end-of-run chest and the barf
bunnies.

Note that the crystal increase may bleed over to other run types as well.
Obviously this mod could also be used to cheat, since it provides quick
access to a lot of loot generation.
