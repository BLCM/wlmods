# This turns out to be a harder problem than you might think, at least for
# this mod in particular (since we don't want any BPChars to share a name).
#
# There's a bunch of places where BPChars might get their displayed names from.
# At the top level there's the SpawnOptions objects, which can specify a name
# to override, and I believe that if specified, that'll override everything
# else.  That's *mostly* used to give unique names to otherwise-generic chars.
#
# Then the BPChar itself has a bunch of different attributes.  The "usual"
# one is found in the AIBalanceStateComponent subobject, in the PlayThroughs
# structure.  Then out on the main export, there's an elemental-mapping attr
# (in Wonderlands mostly just used for Splotch-type enemies), a "wounded"
# attr for, I assume, changing names on wounded enemies, and then a couple of
# custom attributes used on Cyclops (Goliath) enemies to change their name as
# they level up.  Then, finally, there's a TargetableComponent sub-object
# which is often used for NPC-type characters.
#
# For everything but the SpawnOptions name override, I don't really know
# which ones take precedence.  I suspect that it goes something like:
#
#    SpawnOptions -> PlayThroughs -> (Wounded/Elemental/Cyclops) -> Targetable
#
# ... but that's kind of a guess.
#
# The next wrinkle with renaming these things is that most of those attributes
# work by referencing a GbxUIName object to provide the name, and those objects
# are pretty often shared between various BPChars.  This is most apparent during
# boss battles, which tend to have custom "Adds" which can be balanced
# independently of the main game, but which share the UIName of one of the main-
# game enemies.  (Though that's not the *only* example.)  So we can't just
# rename those UINames specifically, since we don't want those shared between
# BPChars.  I've also not had any luck creating new UIName objects with our
# sub-object creation methods, so that possibility is out.  (It *would* be nice
# to be able to do that -- could tailor the names to where they're found in the
# structure, for instance.  Ah well!)
#
# Fortunately, some of those places where names can be assigned *also* support
# setting names directly on the object, rather than redirecting to a UIName
# object.  Specifically, we can do that in the TargetableComponent sub-object,
# and the PlayThroughs struct in AIBalanceStateComponent.  For all the other
# places (SpawnOptions, Wounded, Elemental, and Cyclops), we've got to just
# clear out the object reference entirely so that everything falls back to the
# other methods.
#
# So, good enough so far, but one final wrinkle: we've got to be careful about
# setting our names on "base" objects, and might have to worry about ordering
# in general.  As in any other UE game, objects have inheritance, and GBX makes
# use of that to group BPChars together.  For instance, most NPCs end up
# inheriting from BPChar_GenericNPC or BPChar_Generic_DAF, and operations done
# on those "base" objects can end up affecting objects which have been subclassed
# from those main ones.  On an early version of this mod, I'd noticed that
# Paladin Mike was showing up as one of those "generic" NPC BPChars instead of
# his specific one.  It turned out to be basically down to ordering -- the
# BPChar_PaladinMike naming tweak was happening first, but then later down the
# line one of the generic sets was happening, and I'm pretty sure that was
# overriding the earlier BPChar_PaladinMike statements, since the generic ones
# applied to his BPChar as well.
#
# So, I'd added in a couple of safeguards for that.  First, we loop through the
# references database and try to filter out any BPChars which aren't referenced
# by any Map or SpawnOptions object, and mark those as a char not to process.
# This ends up doing 95% of what we want -- all the various `*_Shared` BPChars
# end up getting excluded from that.  We've also got separate block/allow sets
# to tweak those results a bit -- there's a couple false positives, and also
# a couple false negatives.
#
# And finally, the other thing I did was add in dependency tracking between the
# BPChars.  Using the refs database again, the script makes sure that anything
# that appears to depend on another BPChar gets processed *after* that BPChar.
# So we loop through all the BPChars once to grab the data, then associate the
# objects based on parent/child relationships, and then write everything out in
# the "proper" order.
#
# It's entirely possible that even this isn't quite good enough.  I'm not sure
# how "deep" the object inheritance goes -- there might be a case where you've
# got one BPChar spawning in a map alongside a child BPChar, and it's possible
# that those statements might end up doing the wrong thing even with our ordering
# here.  Still, there's probably not much to be done about that, and the
# results seem quite good overall, regardless.  Just beware of potential wrong
# data being reported!
