Guaranteed Gear Drops
=====================

Makes it so that enemies who have a chance to drop gear will do so.
Killed enemies should drop one gun, melee weapon, ward, spell, ring,
amulet, and armor.  There are probably exceptions to this, but it
should apply to most enemies in the game.

Intended to just be used as a resource mod when testing mods relating
to gear drops.  The rates would be pretty overwhelming for regular play.
