Super Buff: Manual Transmission
===============================

Cheat mod which modifies the Manual Transmission AR with following:

* Absurd amount of damage
* Infinite ammo
* Perfect accuracy/handling
* No recoil
* Increased rate of fire
* No heat generation

Additionally, the mod disables spawning of rails/scopes and elements
on freshly-dropped Manual Transmissions.  The scopes tend to take up
too much of the screen for what I'd like to use for mod-testing, and
the lack of element allows the gun to be useful even when encountering
enemies with elemental immunity.

A level 1 Manual Transmission using this mod will probably last you
throughout an entire story runthough, and probably into some Chaos
levels after that.

This is basically just what I use for testing out mods, when I don't
want to be bothered by combat.
