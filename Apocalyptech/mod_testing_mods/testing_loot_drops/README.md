Testing Loot Drops
==================

This mod isn't actually a general-purpose mod.  Rather, it's what I use to spawn
gear in-game that I'm looking to do something with modwise (generally used when
new DLC/content is out, and I'm looking to make sure I know where all the gear
is, and update all my mods to account for the gear).

To use this, you're meant to edit the generation file and alter the parameters to
suit what you want.  The checked-in version will have each enemy you kill drop
five items from a pool which includes the Goblin Pickaxe melee weapon, Manual
Transmission AR, and Transistor ward -- that's the testing gear I use alongside
my three Super Buff mods.  To get this mod to drop anything else, you'll have to
edit to suit.  (Note that the Goblin Pickaxe won't drop in early-game without
my Early Bloomer mod active, as well.)
