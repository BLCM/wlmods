Super Buff: Goblin Pickaxe
==========================

Cheat mod which modifies the Goblin Pickaxe melee weapon with following:

* Absurd amount of damage
* Vastly increased attack speed
* Disables its ordinary legendary ability
* Disables Elements on freshly-spawned Goblin Pickaxes
* Disables various hilt mods in freshly-spawned Goblin Pickaxes:
  * Amp'd
  * Warded
  * Echo
  * Poisoned

The element/hilt mod changes only apply to freshly-spawned versions;
gear already in your inventory would be unaffected.  The element
changes are so that the weapon remains effective even when encountering
enemies with elemental immunity.  The hilt mod changes are just to
ensure consistency when testing mods -- I like to make sure the only
damage being dealt is damage I specifically cause.

A level 1 Goblin Pickaxe using this mod will probably last you
throughout an entire story runthough, and probably into some Chaos
levels after that.

This is basically just what I use for testing out mods, when I don't
want to be bothered by combat.
