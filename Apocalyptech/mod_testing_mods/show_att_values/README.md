Show Att Values
===============

Resource mod to show the current value of some attributes in-game, for
modding purposes.  Edit the mod-generation script to specify the attrs
you're interested in, regen the mod, and they'll show up in the "stats"
section of the Chaos Mode menu.  Obviously this would require using a
save which has Chaos Mode already unlocked.

The pre-configured attributes to be displayed are the character-weighting
attributes ordinarily used for armor part weighting.

Note that if you've got access to a Wonderlands-capable PythonSDK, it's
a *lot* nicer to just pull attribute values out of that, instead.
