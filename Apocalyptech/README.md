Apocalyptech's Wonderlands Mods
===============================

**NOTE:** This is still a work in progress, and no mods stored here are
usable by the general public.

Welcome to my Wonderlands Mod space!  I've divided this up into category
folders, so click through to see details on the actual mods.  Here's a summary
of the mods you'll find in here, though:

## Economy-Related Mods

- **Free Respawn** - No charge for respawning after death.
- **Free Respec** - No charge to respec your skills.

## Enemy Spawn Changes

## Gameplay Changes

- **Movement Speed Cheats** - Move faster!

## Gear Changes

- **Uniques are Legendary** - Changes the rarity of unique (usually blue/purple) items
  to be legendary instead.

There's one directory in here which is an interactive utility, rather
than a mod:

- **Arbitrary Partlocks** - Given a balance object, interactively define partlocks for it.

## Loot Changes

- **Early Bloomer**- Unlock all weapon types, elements, manufacturers,
  enchantments, etc, from the very beginning of the game.
- **Expanded Legendary Pools** - Adds all legendary/unique items to the world drop pools.
- **No Wasted Equipment** - Armor and Amulet parts will always match the player(s)
  currently in the game.  Will eventually support Enchantments too, but that isn't done yet.
- **Starting Gear** - Some alternate contents for the initial starting
  gear pickups/chests, in Snoring Valley.

## Chaos Changes

## Mission-Specific Changes

## Mod-Testing Mods

- **Super Buff: Goblin Pickaxe** - Absurdly OP Goblin Pickaxe buffs.
- **Super Buff: Manual Transmission** - Absurdly OP Manual Transmission shield.
- **Super Buff: Transistor** - Absurdly OP Transistor shield.
- **Testing Loot Drops** - Used to test drops and verify balance names.

## Quality of Life Mods

- **Mega TimeSaver XL** - Speeds up slow animations throughout the game.
- **Photo Mode Unlock** - Lets the camera in Photo Mode go extremely far, and
  speeds up its movement.

## Deprecated/Broken Mods

## Data Processing

There's also a `dataprocessing` dir here, which is various utils that I use to
pull data from WL, mostly using the `wlmods` and `wlhotfixmod` modules up
in the main dir of this repo.  These are often in service of mod creation, though
there's also scripts which populate some Google Sheets that I maintain as well.
