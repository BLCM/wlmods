Apocalyptech's Wonderlands Mods
===============================

**NOTE:** This is still a work in progress, and no mods stored here are
usable by the general public.

Welcome to my Wonderlands Mod space!  I've divided this up into category
folders, so click through to see details on the actual mods.  Here's a summary
of the mods you'll find in here, though:

## Economy-Related Mods

## Enemy Spawn Changes

## Gameplay Changes

## Gear Changes

## Loot Changes

## Mayhem Changes

## Mission-Specific Changes

## Mod-Testing Mods

## Quality of Life Mods

## Deprecated/Broken Mods

## Data Processing

There's also a `dataprocessing` dir here, which is various utils that I use to
pull data from WL, mostly using the `wlmods` and `wlhotfixmod` modules up
in the main dir of this repo.  These are often in service of mod creation, though
there's also scripts which populate some Google Sheets that I maintain as well.
