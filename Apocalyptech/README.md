Apocalyptech's Wonderlands Mods
===============================

Welcome to my Wonderlands Mod space!  I've divided this up into category
folders, so click through to see details on the actual mods.  Here's a summary
of the mods you'll find in here, though:

## Economy-Related Mods

- **Cheaper SDUs** - Vastly reduce the SDU costs.
- **Free Respawn** - No charge for respawning after death.
- **Free Respec** - No charge to respec your skills.

## Enemy Spawn Changes

## Gameplay Changes

- **Better Overworld Movement** - Allows sprinting and jumping in the Overworld
- **Early Overworld Abilities** - Allows the player to dispel barrier hexes,
  bypass red Dark Magic barriers, and see hidden bridges from the beginning of
  the game.
- **Infinite Slide** - Makes the duration of your character's slide effectively
  infinite.
- **Movement Speed Cheats** - Move faster!
- **Short Overworld Dungeons** - Shortens all Overworld dungeons (single-room
  only, and shorter enemy waves)
- **Skip To DLC Bosses** - Skips directly to the boss chambers when entering
  a mirror in Dreamveil Overlook.

## Gear Changes

- **Enchantment-Spawning Tweaks** - Some collected changes to how Enchantments get
  spawned on gear.  (All applicable gear, even chances, and supported class weighting.)
- **Morph-A-Gunâ„¢ 2000** - A set of mods to make guns morph into other guns the instant
  they're fired.
- **Red Text Explainer** - Adds a description of weapon/spell special effects on the card.
- **Torgue AR Full-Auto** - Makes nearly all Torgue ARs full-auto.
- **Uniques are Legendary** - Changes the rarity of unique (usually blue/purple) items
  to be legendary instead.

There's one directory in here which is an interactive utility, rather
than a mod:

- **Arbitrary Partlocks** - Given a balance object, interactively define partlocks for it.

## Loot Changes

- **Chaos Gear Spawns** - Alters how Chaos-infused gear (Chaotic, Volatile, Primordial,
  or Ascended) are spawned in Chaos Mode.
- **Customization Drop Rate** - A set of mods to change the drop rates for customizations,
  from none at all, to much more than usual.
- **Early Bloomer**- Unlock all weapon types, elements, manufacturers,
  enchantments, etc, from the very beginning of the game.
- **Expanded Legendary Pools** - Adds all legendary/unique items to the world drop pools.
- **Guaranteed Boss Drops** - Bosses/minibosses will always drop from their unique-drop pools.
- **Guaranteed Enchantments** - All dropped/looted gear will be enchanted, if the gear
  supports it.
- **More Elemental Weapons** - Increases the probability of rolling the elemental version
  of any given weapon.
- **No Loot Luck: Better Loot Edition** - Completely removes the effect of Loot Luck on
  gear drops, setting them instead to traditional Better Loot quality weighting.
- **No Wasted Equipment** - Armor and Amulet parts will always match the player(s)
  currently in the game.  Will eventually support Enchantments too, but that isn't done yet.
- **Randomized Boss Drops** - Boss/miniboss drops will be randomized, instead of locked
  to their usual unique drops.
- **Randomized Mission Rewards** - Mission reward items will be randomized.
- **Starting Gear** - Some alternate contents for the initial starting
  gear pickups/chests, in Snoring Valley.

## Chaos Changes

## Mission-Specific Changes

## Mod-Testing Mods

- **Mountaineer** - Allows the player to climb (nearly) vertical surfaces.
- **Super Buff: Goblin Pickaxe** - Absurdly OP Goblin Pickaxe buffs.
- **Super Buff: Manual Transmission** - Absurdly OP Manual Transmission AR.
- **Super Buff: Transistor** - Absurdly OP Transistor shield.
- **Testing Loot Drops** - Used to test drops and verify balance names.

## Quality of Life Mods

- **Always Visible Challenge Icons** - Makes challenge icons visible at all
  times
- **Mega TimeSaver XL** - Speeds up slow animations throughout the game.
- **More Visible Scrolls** - Makes the scroll loot bars (and, incidentally,
  mission items) far more visible
- **No Blacksmith Hammers** - Disables the loud automatic hammers in the
  Brighthoof blacksmith area (right next to the enchantment-reroll machine)
- **No Reload Notification** - Removes the "reload" notification when you're
  near the end of a magazine.
- **Photo Mode Unlock** - Lets the camera in Photo Mode go extremely far, and
  speeds up its movement.
- **Skip DLC Intros** - Skips the DLC intro movies in Dreamveil Overlook, for
  DLCs 1, 2, and 3.  Does *not* work for Shattering Spectreglass (DLC4)!

## Deprecated/Broken Mods

I've also got a folder to contain mods which are proofs-of-concept, or didn't
work, or which are no longer needed (either because of changes to the game itself,
or because it was obsoleted by one of my other mods).  There's a README in there
which details most of those, so feel free to browse around if you want.

## Data Processing

There's also a `dataprocessing` dir here, which is various utils that I use to
pull data from WL, mostly using the `wlmods` and `wlhotfixmod` modules up
in the main dir of this repo.  These are often in service of mod creation, though
there's also scripts which populate some Google Sheets that I maintain as well.
